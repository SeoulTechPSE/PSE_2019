Self consistency deals with a coupled solution of Schrodinger and Poisson equation.

Charge distribution is calculated from the wave functions calculated using Schrodinger equation.
Next this charge distribution is put into Poisson eqn to predict the potential distribution which is again used in Sch eqn. 
This process is repeated with iteration and ultimately stopped when the solution converges.

It gives the actual charge as well as potential distribution inside the  structure under consideration.
